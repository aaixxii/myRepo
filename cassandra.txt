1. Check which version of Java is installed by running the following command: 
  $ java -version

2. Add the Apache repository of Cassandra to /etc/yum.repos.d

$sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/cassandra.repo

[cassandra]
name = Apache Cassandra
baseurl=https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/redhat/311x/
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS

3. Install the packages by using the following command line: 
  sudo yum install cassandra
4. Make Cassandra starts automatically after reboot by typing the following
  $chkconfig cassandra on
5.Configure Cassandra as follows.
  etc/cassandra/ conf/cassandra.yaml
6. starting Cassandra. 
    $ sudo service cassandra start 
7. Issue the following command to verify that Cassandra is ready:
   $ tail /var/log/cassandra/cassandra.log 
8l Verify that Cassandra is running:
  $ nodetool status 

Post installation configuration
To edit /etc/init.d/cassandra to resolve the service control issue

Issue the following command
sudo nano /etc/init.d/cassandra
Locate the line starting with
# chkconfig:
Edit it to contain the following
# chkconfig: 2345 80 80

This will delay the execution to the appropriate point in time.

Next, locate the line starting with
CASSANDRA_PROG=/usr/sbin/cassandra
Insert the following below the line:
#-------  Beginning of Centos7 modifications for startup script
# Note start priority changed from 20 to 80 in chkconfig definition
# create run dir for pid file
[ -d /var/run/cassandra ] || mkdir /var/run/cassandra
chown cassandra /var/run/cassandra
#------  End of Centos7 modifications for startup script

Save the file. Now we must add the service to the boot process:
chkconfig --add cassandra
Now, proceed to edit /etc/cassandra/default.conf/cassandra.yaml
sudo nano /etc/cassandra/default.conf/cassandra.yaml

sudo service cassandra start 

If you get an out of memory error when starting Cassandra, you need to open the file /etc/cassandra/conf/cassandra-env.sh and increase the Java stack size from JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Xss180k" to JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Xss228k". 

To stop Cassandra on Linux

$ sudo service cassandra stop
